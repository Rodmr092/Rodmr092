# Hello, I'm Rodrigo ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a data enthusiast delving into the intricate dance between technology, data, and finance. 
My path is one of curiosity, continuous learning, and discovery, aimed at sharing the adventures and insights I gather along the way.

## About Me

Trained as a Clinical Psychologist, I'm venturing beyond my original field to explore other passions. 
With the AI wave cresting on the horizon, I saw a perfect opportunity to broaden my vistas. 
Now, I'm navigating the financial markets as a "Storytelling Data Scientist," marrying the craft of narrative with the precision of data analysis. 
Despite my non-traditional background in coding and data science, I leverage AI and machine learning tools, especially language models like ChatGPT, 
to demystify the complex dynamics of financial markets.

My mission? To make the nuanced realms of finance and technology accessible to everyone, tearing down the barriers that obscure these critical fields, 
and to inspire those who, like me, aspire to gain meaningful knowledge and skills in new and innovative ways.

## My Projects

- **Trading Research:** A deep dive into the financial markets through the lens of data science and AI. 
This repository is a chronicle of my journey and discoveries, aiming to render the world of finance more approachable.

## How I Work

My approach is one of continuous learning and collaboration. I believe in the power of community and the collective wisdom it can bring to any challenge. 
Whether through coding, writing, or sharing insights, I'm always looking for ways to contribute and learn.

## Let's Connect

I'm keen to connect with fellow enthusiasts, potential collaborators, or anyone interested in a lively discussion about data, finance, technology or life.
